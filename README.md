# Lisondato_DimLightSwitch

Light Dimmer Switch Control

Overview

This Python program simulates a light dimmer switch with five levels of brightness: Off (0%), Low (25%), Medium (50%), High (75%), and Maximum (100%). It allows the user to adjust the light level and provides options to continue adjusting or exit the program.

Usage Instructions
1. Running the Program:
    -Open the Python program in your preferred Python development environment or editor.
    -Execute the program to start the light control interface.
    
2. Adjusting the Light Level:
    -You will be prompted to enter the desired light level using the following options:
        1: Off
        2: Low
        3: Medium
        4: High
        5: Maximum
        0: Close (to exit the program)
    Enter the corresponding number for the desired light level.

3. Continuing or Exiting:
    -After setting the light level, you will have the option to adjust the light again or exit the program.
    -If you choose to adjust the light again (by entering '1'), you can repeat the process.
    -To exit the program, choose '2' when prompted.

4. Invalid Input Handling:
    -If you enter an invalid input (e.g., a non-numeric value or a number outside the valid range), the program will display an error message and prompt you to enter a valid input again.


Notes

-The program ensures that only valid inputs are accepted and provides clear instructions throughout the interaction.

-You can easily customize the program by modifying the adjust_light function to add more functionality or adjust the behavior of the light control.

Enjoy controlling your virtual light dimmer switch!
